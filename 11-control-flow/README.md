The box you're attempting to add doesn't support the provider
you requested. Please find an alternate box or use an alternate
provider. Double-check your requested provider to verify you didn't
simply misspell it.

If you're adding a box from HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud, make sure the box is
released.

There was an error while command execution. The command and stderr is shown below.

Stderr: Failed to start the VM: This product was activated for a limited period of time that has now expired. Purchase a new activation key (https://www.parallels.com/buy-pdfm17-en_PH/) to continue using Parallels Desktop.
```

Nope. Not having a Parallels run VM either. It's expensive just to test out control flow.

Just taking notes for now.

## üìù Using `when`

```yaml
--- using when
- hosts: webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: "install apache2 webserver"
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
    - name: "install httpd webserver"
      apt:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Redhat"
```

Cons:  

- Hard to maintain

Set of user files.

Scenario: Put in user configuration when a name exists (arbitrary condition)

```yaml
--- setup user configuration using when
- hosts: webservers
  become: true
  vars:
    users:
      - "Justin"
      - "Aubri"
      - "Cherokee"
      - "Daniel"
      - "Zach"
  tasks:
    - name: "install apache2 webserver"
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
    - name: "install httpd webserver"
      apt:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Redhat"
    - name: "remove previous user configuration"  # just for educational purposes  
      file:
        path: /tmp/users.xml
        state: absent
    - name: "setup user configuration"
      template:
        src: ./users.xml.j2
        dest: /tmp/users.xml
      when: "'Cherokee' in users"  # Condition: Is the username in the list of users?
```

Templating is a way of using Jinja2 templating engine to abstract away repetitive tasks.

Template: users.xml.j2

```j2
<Users>
  {% for user in users %}
  <User>{{ user }}</User>
  {% endfor %}
</Users>
```

Pros:

- Customizable
- Specificity

## üìù Using `roles`

Next lesson.

## üìù Using variable rules

```yaml
--- setup user configuration using when
- hosts: webservers
  become: true
  vars:
    users:
      - "Justin"
      - "Aubri"
      - "Cherokee"
      - "Daniel"
      - "Zach"
  vars_files:
    - "./{{ ansible_os_family }}.variables.yml"
  handlers:
    - name: "restart the webserver"
      service:
        name: "{{ webserver }}"
        state: restarted
  tasks:
    - name: "install apache2 webserver"
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
    - name: "install httpd webserver"
      apt:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
    - name: "remove previous user configuration"  # just for educational purposes  
      file:
        path: /tmp/users.xml
        state: absent
    - name: "setup user configuration"
      template:
        src: ./users.xml.j2
        dest: /tmp/users.xml
      when: "'Cherokee' in users"  # Condition: Is the username in the list of users?
      notify: "restart the webserver"
```

```yaml
--- RedHat.variables.yml
webserver: "apache2"
```

```yaml
--- Debian.variables.yml
webserver: "httpd"
```

Defined same variable name depending on the platform.
